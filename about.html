    <h1 class="h1-about">About eScooter Price Hub</h1>
    <h2 class="h2-about">Why this website ?</h2>
    <p class="p-about">
        The purpose of this website is to help you easily discover and 
        compare the best electric scooters available on Amazon. With so many options 
        on the market, choosing the right scooter can be overwhelming. That’s 
        why we’ve created a simple, user-friendly platform that brings together 
        top-rated products, honest reviews, and helpful guides—all in one place. 
        Our goal is to save you time and make your buying decision easier, 
        so you can enjoy the freedom and convenience of electric scooters with
         confidence. As an Amazon affiliate, we may earn a small commission when 
         you make a purchase using our links, but this comes at no extra cost to you. 
        </p>
    <h2 class="h2-about">Why doesn't this product appear on your site?</h2>
    <p class="p-about">
        All the eScooters featured on this website are selected manually 
        based on my personal research, not by automated scripts. 
        As a result, some noteworthy pieces may be missing. Please note that this is just an initial list, 
        and I will be adding more eScooters over time.
    </p>
    <h2 class="h2-about">What about shipping?</h2>
    <p class="p-about">
       The prices shown on this site do not include shipping fees or taxes, 
       as these can vary depending on your location. Most listings offer free shipping,
     but we recommend confirming shipping costs 
        and any additional charges before completing your purchase.
    </p>
    <h2 class="h2-about">Who are you ?!</h2>
    <p class="p-about">I’m a passionate developer and e-scooter enthusiast. Combining my love for technology and 
        urban mobility, I created this website to share the best e-scooter deals and recommendations as an affiliate.
         My goal is to help others discover reliable, innovative, and fun ways to get around while making informed 
         choices. Whether you’re a newcomer or a seasoned rider, you’ll find honest reviews and curated selections 
         here — powered by my personal experience and research.</p>
