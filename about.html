    <h1 class="h1-about">About eScooter Price Hub</h1>
    <h2 class="h2-about">Why this website ?</h2>
    <p class="p-about">
        The purpose of this website is to help you easily discover and 
        compare the best electric scooters available on Amazon. With so many options 
        on the market, choosing the right scooter can be overwhelming. That’s 
        why we’ve created a simple, user-friendly platform that brings together 
        top-rated products, honest reviews, and helpful guides—all in one place. 
        Our goal is to save you time and make your buying decision easier, 
        so you can enjoy the freedom and convenience of electric scooters with
         confidence. As an Amazon affiliate, we may earn a small commission when 
         you make a purchase using our links, but this comes at no extra cost to you. 
        </p>
    <h2 class="h2-about">Why doesn't this product appear on your site?</h2>
    <p class="p-about">
        We carefully curate our product listings to ensure quality and reliability
         by removing duplicates, fake products, spam, and out-of-stock items.
          This thorough filtering process eliminates about 1.9% of all listings. 
          Occasionally, our algorithms may not be able to categorize certain products,
           which can result in their temporary exclusion. These unclassified products 
           are periodically reviewed by a human editor to maintain the accuracy and 
           completeness of our selection.


    </p>
    <h2 class="h2-about">What about shipping?</h2>
    <p class="p-about">
       The prices shown on this site do not include shipping fees or taxes, 
       as these can vary depending on your location. Most listings offer free shipping,
     but we recommend confirming shipping costs 
        and any additional charges before completing your purchase.
